# About SSL certificates
{: #about-ssl-certificates}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers yearly and bi-yearly SSL certificates for customers that offer various benefits, including:

* Gull authentication for business identity and domain ownership verification
* 40- to 256-bit encryption on all online transactions
* Daily website malware scanning to ensure that both your site and your customers are protected

If you are running multiple domains, an SSL certificate can be purchased for each domain.

Within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, all SSL certificates ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can be managed from the SSL Orders page. This page tracks all orders, including the common name, certificate type, and expiration date of the certificate, but does not contain any certificate-specific details such as the certificate itself or the Private Key. From this page, current and expired SSL certificates can be renewed under their pre-existing terms and fulfillment emails can be requested to receive the SSL certificate details if they are lost. All requests that are made from the SSL Orders screen are routed to the appropriate certificate authority for the SSL certificate, which completes the requests as necessary. Because {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} doesn't possess the SSL certificate details, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is unable to provide any additional information about the certificate.

In addition to managing SSL certificates ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can import SSL certificate data to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to use the data with the various products and services. All interactions with imported SSL certificates take place on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. You can manually import, edit, and export SSL certificate details that are present on this screen. In addition, SSL certificates can be deleted at any time. As with the SSL Orders screen, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} doesn't control, track, or record this information, as it is considered one of the most confidential pieces of information that you possess. SSL certificate details that are stored on this screen are used only with an account's products or services when you set them up.

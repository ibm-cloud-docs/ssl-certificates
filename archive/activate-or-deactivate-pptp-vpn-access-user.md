# Activating or deactivating PPTP VPN access
{: #activating-or-deactivating-pptp-vpn-access}

PPTP VPN allows you to form a secure tunnel to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} private network by using specialized client software that runs on your desktop or dedicated device. PPTP access is designed if you need to connect an entire office or cannot use the SSL VPN solution. You are allotted one PPTP connection with more connections available, and you can request support to enable unlimited PPTP access, which is available at no additional charge. To activate or deactivate PPTP VPN access for a user, complete the following steps.

SSL Certificate Order is deprecated. As of 15 April 2024, SSL Certificate Order is no longer available for purchase. As of 15 December 2024,  SSL Certificate Order is no longer supported for new orders or reorders. Only existing certificates that are not expired are still available for you to download, reissue, or revoke. For more information, see [Deprecation of SSL Certificates](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-deprecation).
{: deprecated}


Within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, you can manage and track SSL certificates that are ordered from both {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and other third-party companies. SSL certificates are required to enable features on some products, such as [Load Balancers](/docs/local-load-balancer?topic=local-load-balancer-about-load-balancing#about-load-balancing), and their data must be stored within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to enable those features. All interactions with SSL certificates, including importing, editing, and exporting, are performed on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

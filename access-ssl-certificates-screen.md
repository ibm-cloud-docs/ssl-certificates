Within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, you can manage and track SSL certificates that are ordered from both {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and other third-party companies. SSL certificates are required to enable features on some products, such as Load Balancers, and their data must be stored within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to enable those features. All interactions with SSL certificates, including importing, editing, and exporting, are performed on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

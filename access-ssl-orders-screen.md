# Accessing SSL orders
{: #accessing-ssl-orders}

SSL Certificate Order is deprecated. As of 15 April 2024, SSL Certificate Order is no longer available for purchase. As of 15 December 2024,  SSL Certificate Order is no longer supported for new orders or reorders. Only existing certificates that are not expired are still available for you to download, reissue, or revoke. For more information, see [Deprecation of SSL Certificates](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-deprecation).

The SSL orders screen contains a listing of all SSL certificates that are ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for the history of the account. Details that are included on this screen include the SSL certificate's common name, certificate type, and expiration date. From this screen, you can renew the certificate or resend the fulfillment email. Any SSL certificates that are stored on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console that have not been ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} are not available on this screen.

## Next steps
{: #ns-accessing-ssl-orders}

After accessing the SSL orders screen, all SSL certificates ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} are listed. Certificates are displayed by their expiration date from oldest to newest, meaning that certificates that have already expired are displayed first, by default. From this screen, you can [renew SSL certificates](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-renewing-ssl-certificates#renewing-an-ssl-certificate) and [request that the fulfillment email be resent](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-requesting-an-ssl-certificate-fulfillment-email).

# Deleting SSL certificates
{: #deleting-ssl-certificates}

After an SSL certificate's details are imported into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, it can be deleted at any time to remove all data from being saved to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

If an SSL certificate has an attached service, that service must be removed first, otherwise **Delete** is not an available action.
{: important}

To delete an SSL certificate, complete the following steps.

1. Navigate to your console's security menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
2. From the **Security** menu, select **SSL > Certificates**.
3. From the **Actions** menu, select **Delete** for the desired SSL certificate.
4. Click **Yes** to delete the SSL certificate..

## Next steps
{: #ns-deleting-ssl-certificates}

After deleting an SSL certificate, all services that are linked to the certificate no longer use its information. The certificate no longer appears on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Update all services that previously used the deleted certificate to be associated with a valid SSL certificate that is associated with the account.

At any time, the SSL certificate can be added back to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console by using the [import](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-importing-ssl-certificates#importing-ssl-certificates) process.

# Introduction to SSL technology
{: #introduction-to-ssl-technology}

SSL Certificate Order is deprecated. As of 15 April 2024, SSL Certificate Order is no longer available for purchase. As of 15 December 2024, SSL Certificate Order is no longer supported for new orders or reorders. Only existing certificates that are not expired are still available for you to download, reissue, or revoke. For more information, see [Deprecation of SSL Certificates](/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-deprecation).

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application. This encryption is accomplished by using a public key or private key system that uses an SSL certificate. The SSL certificate contains the serverâ€™s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a hostname for which the certificate is valid, and a signature from the certificate authority that issued it.

## SSL terminology

SSL certificates have unique terminology. You might encounter the following terms while you work with SSL certificates.

### Bit size
Encryption keys are measured by their size in bits. For example, 512 bit, 1024 bit, 2048 bit. Generally, a longer key is going to be safer but slower to use. Currently, the minimum size for the keys that are used in SSL certificates is 1024 bit, though the Extended Validation certificates require 2048 bit.

### Certificate chain
SSL certificates are not generally used alone. In most implementations, you deal with a certificate chain. For example,

```
Root > intermediate1 > server cert.

\> Intermediate2 > server2 cert
```
{: screen}

In this example, your server certificate is signed by the intermediate certificate, which is in turn signed by the root certificate. Chaining in this fashion can make SSL more secure because it means that the root certificate is not used (and exposed to risk) so often. If `intermediate1` was compromised, then `server cert` might be in danger, but `server2 cert` would be fine because they are part of different chains.

### Certificate signing request
The certificate signing request (CSR) is a document that you generate on the server that contains information that the certificate authority uses to create your actual certificate.

### Common name
The common name (CN) is the hostname for which the certificate is valid (for example, www.domain.com).

www.domain.com, smtp.domain.com, and mail.domain.com are three different hostnames and the same SSL certificate is not valid for all three of them (unless you are using a wildcard certificate but currently {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} does not offer those certificates).

### Private or public key
SSL uses a technique called public key cryptography. In this form of cryptography, you have two keys: the public and the private. The public key is distributed far and wide. No one sees your private key. People who want to communicate securely with you encrypt their communication by using your public key. Public key cryptography is based on the assertion that bits encrypted with a given public key can be decrypted by using only the corresponding private key and conversely.

### Root certificate
The SSL root certificates are certificates that are signed themselves and are presented to the world by their respective certificate authorities. Root certificates for certificate authorities are already installed in the certificate store for your web browser. Which allows your browser to trust those certificates and forms the beginnings of the chain of trust that ultimately leads to the certificate you install on your server.

### Signature
SSL certificates have a digital signature that is placed on them by the certificate authority. This signature, when traced back to a trusted root certificate, confirms the authenticity of the certificate.

## SSL at IBM Cloud infrastructure

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resells three types of SSL certificates: Domain Validation, Organization Validation, and Extended Validation.

Domain validation (DV) certificates are inexpensive and available quickly. The validation that is done by the certificate authority is limited to sending an email to a specified email address at the domain in question and getting a positive reply. Organization Validation (OV) and Extended Validation (EV) certificates take a couple of days (sometimes a week), cost more, and result in deeper checks by the certificate authority. The EV certificates are coded in such a way that browsers recognize them as EV and display a green bar as part of the address bar.

SSL certificates, like other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, can be managed through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Go to the **Security** menu and select the **SSL** option to order and manage certificates.

SSL certificates that are ordered through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} do not have to be used on an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} server. In addition, certificates ordered elsewhere can be used on your servers that are hosted here.
{: note}

SSL certificates enhance the security of the transactions and give your users a sense of security. In addition to SSL certificates, Daemon security, physical security, coding practices, and certificate handling all combine to form the overall security profile of the solution.
